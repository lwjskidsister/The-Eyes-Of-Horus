        <section class="info">
            <section class="explanation">
                <p>The Rosetta Stone was created in 196 BCE during the reign of Ptolemy V. It contains a decree issued by priests to honor the young king, written in Greek, Demotic, and hieroglyphs so it could be understood by different groups. It was discovered by French soldiers in Egypt in 1799. The reason the “Rosetta Stone” is incredibly important
                because it allowed scholars to finally decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, a language that had been lost for centuries. After Napoleon’s defeat, the British took the stone in 1801, and it has been in the British Museum since 1802. Its discovery and translation opened the door to understanding ancient Egypt's history, culture, and written language.

        <section class="info">
            <section class="explanation">
                <p>The Bust of Nefertiti was crafted around 1345 BCE by the sculptor Thutmose in his workshop in Amarna. It is a limestone sculpture of Queen Nefertiti, wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten, and is known for its stunning craftsmanship and beauty. It was likely created as a model to showcase Queen Nefertiti’s beauty and royal stature. Found in Thutmose's workshop, it has become one of the most iconic representations of ancient Egyptian art. The Bust of Nefertiti was discovered in 1912 by a German archaeological team led by Ludwig Borchardt in Amarna, Egypt. The bust was taken to Germany, where it remains on display at the Neues Museum in Berlin. Egypt has repeatedly requested its return, but Germany has refused.

            <section class="explanation">
                <p>The Dendera Zodiac was made around 50 BCE as part of the Temple of Hathor’s ceiling in Dendera, Egypt. It’s an elaborate relief showing constellations and celestial events, reflecting ancient Egyptian knowledge of the stars. The zodiac is historically important because it provides insights into the Egyptians' understanding of astronomy and their religious beliefs linked to the stars. It was discovered by French archaeologist Claude Sicard in 1820 during Napoleon’s campaign in Egypt.The zodiac was taken to France and is now housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris.

        <section class="info">
            <section class="explanation">
                <p>The Luxor Obelisks were originally erected in front of the
                    Luxor Temple in Egypt around 1300 BCE by Pharaoh
                    Ramesses II. They are tall, four-sided monuments covered in
                    hieroglyphs that celebrate the pharaoh’s reign.
                    Historically, they are significant as an example of ancient
                    Egyptian monumental art and engineering.
                    The Luxor Obelisks were standing at the Luxor Temple when
                    Muhammad Ali Pasha, in 1833, gifted one of them to France and it was moved to Paris. It now stands in the Place de la Concorde. Egypt has requested its return, but the obelisk remains in France.

        <section class="info">
            <section class="explanation">
                <p>The Sarcophagus of Pharaoh Seti I is a large alabaster
                    coffin used to contain the mummified remains of
                    Pharaoh Seti I. It was made around 1300 BCE and is
                    renowned for its elaborate carvings depicting funerary
                    texts, religious symbols, and gods, which were
                    intended to protect the pharaoh in the afterlife.
                    British archaeologist Giovanni Belzoni discovered the
                    sarcophagus in 1821 in the Valley of the Kings, where it
                    was originally entombed. It was subsequently
                    transported to England and is now displayed at Sir
                    John Soane’s Museum in London.
                    Egypt has formally requested the return of the
                    sarcophagus, emphasizing its importance to their
                    cultural heritage, but it remains in the UK to this day. Learn more and see more <a href="https://www.soane.org/sarcophagus-seti-i" title="Learn more about the Sarcophagus">here</a></p>

        <section class="info">
            <section class="explanation">
                <p>The Sphinx of Tanis is a large granite statue with the
                    head of a Pharaoh and a lion's body, created around 26
                    BCE. It was made to symbolize the Pharaoh’s power
                    and divine protection, embodying the fusion of royal
                    and divine attributes that was central to ancient
                    Egyptian beliefs.
                    The sphinx was discovered in Tanis (modern-day San
                    el-Hagar) in Egypt in 1825 by French Egyptologist
                    Jean-François Champollion. It was later taken to
                    France and is now housed in the Louvre Museum in
                    Paris.
                    Egypt has requested its return, highlighting its
